# compilersProject

## Description 

This repository provides the basic structure for a C development project. 

# Project Structure 

```
compilersProject/
├── bin
├── include
├── Makefile
├── obj
├── README.md
└── src
    └── main.c

```

## Branch Strategy 

There will be a branch in this repository for each practice assignment throughout the semester.

## Run 

We need GCC and Make 
```
Make 
Make run
```

## Interaction Contract (Input/Output)

Each program will fulfill the Unix pipe contract: 
```
Input (stdin): Reads source code.
Output (stdout): Prints results (tokens, AST, code).
Errors (stderr): Reports errors.
```
## Language Specification

This repository and all practices will be in English.
